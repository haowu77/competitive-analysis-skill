# Methodology

## 1. Problem framing (JTBD-first)
- Define user job-to-be-done, user segment, key decision moments, and buying criteria.
- Distinguish core use case from adjacent workflows.

## 2. Competitor discovery
Use multi-source discovery and avoid single-source bias:
- Official product websites/docs/pricing pages
- App stores and software directories
- Independent reviews and industry media
- Public signals (launch posts, changelogs, company updates)

## 3. Competitor classification
- Direct: same JTBD and similar monetization/usage path
- Adjacent: overlap on JTBD but different path or segment
- Substitute: solves the same outcome with a different category

## 4. Filtering and ranking
- Remove low-evidence or unavailable products.
- Keep default top 8 by relevance and evidence quality.

## 5. Benchmark synthesis
- Use normalized 1-5 scoring.
- Keep claims traceable to source rows.
- Separate observations from recommendations.
